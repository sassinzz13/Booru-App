Team Solei Booru App Api


what the api does: it stores data from the booru json api 
and sends it to the front expand


Note: We are just a team of 2 people as of now
and we just started making our very own project
and were just doing this for fun and to learn 

Additional Notes can be found at the index.js file 

//additional information

in index.js is where youll find everything you need
in terms of hosting the API


Proceed to indexRouters for the json API
meaning this is where youll find the main backend API's
will proceed to grow larger and larger as we expand and learn more


callApi is useless since i thought were supposed to use it
(i should just delete this tbh but ill add it as a display ;)

api.json is just a copy of the API's


What we used for dependencies is inside package.json

Check backendStudies for a complete note of backend
it is noted by me for future use just incase i
forget how it works
(koshkii is my online friend btw and if u can understand tagalog please understand that that is just a joke thank you )


Backend made by Team Solei's Izumi
